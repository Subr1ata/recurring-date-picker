This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

## Docker
To run the application in a Docker container, navigate to the project root and run the following command:

# Development
1) pnpm docker-dev:up (Runs the application in a Docker container)
2) pnpm docker-dev:down (Stops the Docker container)

# Production
1) pnpm docker-prod:up (Builds and runs the application in a Docker container)
2) pnpm docker-prod:down (Stops the Docker container)

# For Windows
Install WSL 2 or above for smoother experience with docker. Then Clone the repository inside WSL and navigate to the project root. Open the code in code editor from WSL environment, WSL extension in VS Code is recommended.


First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
